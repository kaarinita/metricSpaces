Introduction
-------------------------------------------------

This is a database of program fragments (trees)  extracted from binary programs.
This set of trees is used to detect GPL license violations (binary program matching).
For more information: http://www.furiachan.org

The current space only includes the distance function mtd from the paper:

Arnoldo Jose Muller Molina, Kouichi Hirata and Takeshi Shinohara:
A Tree Distance Function Based on Multi-sets
Proc. JSAI PAKDD 2008 Post-Workshop Proceedings
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence

We have other tree distance function implementations (in Java)

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------

Only one library is required:

* Antlr 2.7 for C++



Format details
-------------------------------------------------

Our trees are stored using a string representation. 

Example:
"a(b,e)" 

This string creates the tree:
    a
   / \
  b   e
